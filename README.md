# LawAssist

## Overview

A legal assistant which can summarise any form of a legal document and answer specific queries regarding the document

We present Case Studies, a web app that accepts a legal document (preferably proceedings of a court case, terms and conditions document) IN TXT FORMAT, and using model named facebook/bart-large-cnn to generates a concise summary of the document and simplify the document into plain text by removing jargons which are easy to understand by non-lawyer individuals or small businessman. It highlights the main points of it.

Just upload the legal proceeddings of the case IN THE FORM OF A TXT FILE (no other formats are supported as of now). Don't worry about privacy issues, we don't store the document in our servers at all.
